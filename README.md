# J-Abbreviate
Shortener of scientific journal names.

## Scope
Often, scientific journals ask the bibliography to include the abbreviated version of referenced journal names (e.g. Journal of Theoretical Biology --> J Theo Biol). 
This little program automatises the process, by providing the abbreviation of journal names or substituting bibliography entries in .bib files.

## Use
Simply download `JournalNameAbbr.py` and run it from any terminal using _python3_.  
Two functions are available: entering a single journal name or a file to process.  
After the desired function is selected, follow the instructions.

### Processing a references file
The code processes bibliography files written in [.bib](https://www.bibtex.org/) style. However, I could not find a .bib parser that suited the programming needs, hence this code works with .txt files.  
Therefore, make this **extra manual step**: copy-paste your .bib file content into a .txt, run the program, and copy-paste the output _shortBib.txt_ file back into a .bib

## Example
Say you have a .bib file with the following entry:

```
@article{myAuthor2023,
	title={A very nice paper written by someone important},
	author={Author, My},
	journal={Journal of Impressive Science},
	volume={1},
	number={1}
	pages={1},
	year={2023},
}
```
- Copy-paste this content into a _references.txt_ file
- In a terminal window, `>> python3 JournalNameAbbr.py`
- Select to get a single journal name (1) or to parse the whole references file (2)
- If you chose 1, type the journal name
- If you chose 2, provide the path to the _references.txt_ file
- Run it. If multiple journals bear similar names, you will be asked to select the one you want
- Get the  _shortBib.txt_ in the same folder as your original file (that is kept for future usage). Its  _journal_ entries have been shortened.
- Copy-paste its content in a .bib file to link it to your LaTex documents
